		<p>You can select any topic to start but if you are taking the learning for the first time we suggest you look at them in order.</p>
		<p>Each topic has a number of screens. A page indicator shows you what screen you are on and how many pages there are in each topic.</p>
		<p>When you exit the course your progress will be remembered. So when you return you can return to the same place if you want to.</p>
		<p>To complete the course you'll need to pass the assessment with a score of 80% or more.</p>
		<p>At the top of the screen are these buttons: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Exit - to close the module</li>
			<li>Help - to open this help screen</li>
			<li>Menu - to return to the main menu</li>
			<li>Resources - to open a list of useful links for further information</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Either side of the screen are these buttons: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Back - to move back a screen</li>
			<li>Next - to move forward a screen</li>
