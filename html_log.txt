  <p>Message from the CEO</p> 
  <p>BODY TEXT</p> 
  <p>Hello and welcome to our competition law course.</p> 
  <p>At Severn Trent, our vision is to be the most trusted water company by 2020 – and that means always acting in an honest and ethical way.</p> 
  <p>As you'd expect, we're fully committed to complying with competition law and this course is a big part of helping us with that. As you know, from April 2017 approximately 1.2 million eligible business customers in England will be able to choose their supplier of water and sewerage retail services. So it will be even more important that all of us are able to identify anti-competitive behaviour, and this is where this brilliant course comes in.</p> 
  <p>Any breach of competition law means really serious consequences for companies and individuals – and could mean a disciplinary action or worse. So please do take the time to complete the course and make sure that you've taken it all in by testing yourself at the end.</p> 
  <p>If you've got any questions, or would like some advice, then please do contact our General Counsel team.</p> 
  <p>Thanks very much for your support.</p> 
  <p>Best wishes</p> 
  <p>Liv</p>

  <p>BODY TEXT</p> 
  <p>Competition law in the UK is enforced primarily by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). However, in relation to the regulated business of Severn Trent Water (i.e. the provision of water and wastewater services), OFWAT also has enforcement powers.</p> 
  <p>OFWAT and the CMA must agree which authority is best placed to conduct an investigation. However, legislation gives both the power to enforce and sanction.</p>

  <p>SCREEN TITLE</p> 
  <p>What is a dominant position?</p> 
  <p>BODY TEXT</p> 
  <p>Let's begin by looking at the definition of dominant position adopted in numerous cases by European Court: </p> 
  <p>"A position of economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which enables it to prevent effective competition being maintained on the relevant market by giving it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumers."</p> 
  <p>In simple terms, a company will hold a dominant position if it can effectively do as it wishes without worrying too much about either its competitors' or customers' reactions.</p>

  <p>To establish whether a company is dominant, we need to assess its market and its activities. </p> 
  <p>A business with a 50% market share is presumed dominant. But dominance may well exist with market shares of 40% or more.</p>

  <p>Within its area of appointment Severn Trent Water has 100% market share for providing wholesale water and wastewater services.</p> 
  <p>That means Severn Trent Water operates as a monopoly provider, and will be automatically regarded as holding a dominant position in this market.</p> 
  <p>Holding a position like this is not against the rules, but abusing that position is.</p> 
  <p>Severn Trent Water therefore has a special duty not to act in an anti-competitive manner.</p>

  <p>Excessive pricing can occur when a dominant company abuses its position by charging unfairly high prices for its products and services.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 2 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Predatory pricing is when a dominant company is prepared to suffer losses by charging very low prices in order to eliminate or substantially weaken a competitor's market position.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 3 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Discriminatory pricing occurs when a dominant company charges different customers or different classes of customer different prices for goods or services which cost the same – without any valid justification for doing so.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 4 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>A margin squeeze happens when a dominant company for a particular product or service at a wholesale level of the supply chain (i.e. the upstream market) also trades at the retail level of the supply chain (i.e. the downstream market), but charges higher prices to third-party retailers than it does to its own integrated or associated retailer.</p> 
  <p>These higher costs create a reduction or 'squeeze' on the margin of the third-party retailer – even though they may be just as efficient in the downstream market as the wholesale supplier's integrated or associate retailer.</p>

  <p>PROMPT</p> 
  <p>Select each heading to find out more.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 1 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>An abuse may take place if the dominant company limits access to essential upstream facilities (a monopoly water / waste network, for example) or makes it so costly that a downstream business is unable to compete.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 2 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>'Tying' is an abusive practice in which a dominant company agrees to supply a particular product or service only if a purchaser agrees to buy other unrelated products or services from that company. </p> 
  <p>These are often referred to as 'tying clauses' within contracts and are prohibited under competition law.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 3 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Another form of abuse is when a dominant company uses discounts and rebates to tie a customer to them as sole supplier for future business, or to prevent them from buying from a rival supplier. </p> 
  <p>It is fine to offer customers genuine volume rebates or discounts (for example, where real costs savings are achieved by providing in bulk), but these must be justifiable based on actual economies of scale and operated under a transparent system where the customer can clearly see how the discounts will apply. </p> 
  <p>Any rebate which 'locks in' all or an increased proportion of a customer's business, and therefore prevents customers from buying products from competitors, is anti-competitive and prohibited when implemented by a dominant business.</p>

  <p>SCREEN TITLE</p> 
  <p>Leveraging a dominant position</p> 
  <p>BODY TEXT</p> 
  <p>Competition law also stops dominant companies from 'leveraging' their dominance in one market into different, but related, markets.</p> 
  <p>A prime example of this would be where a dominant company subsidises a sister or group company in a different but related market, thereby giving that company an advantage over its competitors.</p> 
  <p>Severn Trent Water is obliged under its Instrument of Appointment to ensure dealings with associate companies are conducted at 'arm's length'. It also needs to make sure that it neither gives nor receives any cross-subsidy. </p> 
  <p> If Severn Trent Water adheres to these licence requirements, it is less likely to abuse its position. However, just complying with the requirements does not guarantee full compliance with competition law.</p>

  <p>PROMPT</p> 
  <p>Select each heading to find out more.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 1 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Price fixing usually occurs when two or more competitors get together to agree on prices for their products or services. This is sometimes referred to as a cartel.</p> 
  <p>Prices could include margins, discounts, wholesale or retail prices, rebates, or pricing changes.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 2 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>This is where competitors agree either not to submit a bid in a tender, or to submit a bid at a particular price.</p> 
  <p>Discussing the fact that you are bidding (or not) should be avoided – act independently and do not discuss bids with competitors. This is particularly important for Severn Trent Services (STS).</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 3 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Commercially sensitive information includes future business strategy (not in the public domain), prices, future product specifications or any other information that may allow a competitor to adjust its own commercial conduct in the market. Such information should not be shared. New legal developments and best practice fall outside this. </p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 4 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>This is where competitors attempt to boost profits by agreeing between themselves to reduce and limit production of particular products.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 5 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Two or more parties agree to give up the manufacture of a particular product and only obtain it from the other party instead. Or they may jointly agree to have a product manufactured exclusively. </p> 
  <p>These agreements could be anti-competitive if they limited potential new entrants to the market.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 6 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>This is where companies divide markets or choose to serve only a certain section of customers.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 7 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>An example for this could be where competitors in the same industry agree to produce only goods with specified dimensions, type or quality. </p> 
  <p>This affects competition as it potentially prevents new competitors from entering the market and also stifles innovation. </p>

  <p>On 1 June 2016, Severn Trent Water and United Utilities combined their non-household retail business to create a new retailer, Water Plus.</p> 
  <p>On market opening in April 2017, Severn Trent Water will complete its 'retail exit' to Water Plus. That means all of Severn Trent Water's NHH customers will be served under a Water Plus licence and Severn Trent Water will no longer be able to provide retail services to NHH customers. </p>

  <p>As Water Plus is 50% owned by Severn Trent Water and 50% owned by United Utilities, Water Plus is a "related" company for the purpose of Severn Trent Water's Instrument of Appointment. </p> 
  <p>All transactions between Severn Trent Water and Water Plus will therefore need to be at "arm's length", with no preferential treatment compared to other retailers.</p>

  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 1 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Severn Trent Water's licence of appointment governs how it should operate.</p> 
  <p>Licence condition F requires Severn Trent Water to:</p> 
  <p>"Ensure that every transaction between the Appointed Business and Associated Company (or between the Appointed Business and any other business or activity of the Appointee) is at arm's length, so that neither gives to or receives from the other any cross-subsidy".</p> 
  <p>Whilst compliance with our licence conditions will not automatically mean we are compliant with competition law, it will mean that, as a business, we are less likely to infringe competition law.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 2 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>It is important that Severn Trent Water treats other Severn Trent companies no differently from how it deals with external businesses. It must not give Associated Companies preferential treatment because of its position within the Severn Trent Group.</p> 
  <p>Water Plus is no different to any other retailer.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 3 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Severn Trent Water must pay the correct price for the goods or services it receives from a related Severn Trent company – neither overpaying nor underpaying for the quality of goods or services received.</p> 
  <p>Conversely, Severn Trent Water must also receive the correct price for services it provides to a related Severn Trent company.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 4 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>The new retail market will only be successful if customers and all companies in the market believe there is a 'level playing field'. In other words, existing water companies and their associated retailers do not have an unfair advantage over new companies entering the market.</p> 
  <p>As an existing water company, we have to ensure we treat all retailers the same.</p>

  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 2 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>The CMA or OFWAT may turn up at a company's premises unannounced, enter and search for documents as part of their investigation. This is known as a 'dawn raid'.</p> 
  <p>If this happens, it is important that we co-operate fully, as obstructing officers from carrying out their investigations is an offence. Severn Trent Water has a 'Dawn Raid Manual' which is available on the information hub and should be reviewed.</p> 
  <p>Dawn raids may also be part of a criminal investigation. In such instances, inspectors are more likely to have a warrant to exercise additional powers, such as powers to search domestic premises (i.e. employees' houses) and vehicles.</p> 
  <p>TEXT FOR REVEAL 3 (50 words max)</p> 
  <p>Section 188 of the Enterprise Act 2002 sets out that it is a criminal offence for two or more competing companies to agree, directly or indirectly, to fix prices, to restrict supply or production, or to enter into bid-rigging or market-sharing arrangements. </p> 
  <p>The CMA has the power to bring a criminal prosecution for cartel offences and can use their other powers, like dawn raids, to gather further evidence as part of their criminal investigation. </p>

  <p>Abuse of a dominant position</p> 
  <p>BODY TEXT</p> 
  <p>A dominant position is usually defined as a position of economic strength that allows you to act independently of competitors or customers. It isn't unlawful to be dominant but it is unlawful to abuse your dominant position to hinder effective competition.</p> 
  <p>Key questions to ask:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Can the company do what it wants without worrying about the impact on its customers?</li> 
   <li>Do the customers have a choice of getting the product or service from someone else?</li>

  <p>Leveraging</p> 
  <p>This is where a dominant company leverages its dominance in a related market and this affects competition. </p> 
  <p>For example, where a dominant company subsidises a sister or group company in a different but related market whereby that company obtains an advantage over its competitors.</p> 
  <p>Key questions to ask: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Could Severn Trent Water be seen as leveraging its dominance in another market to help a group company? </li> 
   <li>Will this have an effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition?</li>

  <p>Anti-competitive agreements</p> 
  <p>An agreement or concerted practice between two businesses which may affect trade and has as its object the restriction, prevention or distortion of competition.</p> 
  <p>Key questions to ask: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Are we sharing any commercially sensitive information that may allow a competitor to adjust its own commercial conduct in the market in response to that information or compromise the independence of its decision making?</li> 
   <li>Are we placing bids on tenders independently and without discussing with other competitors?</li> 
   <li>Are we entering into any agreements to divide the market with our competitors or fix prices for products or services?</li>

  <p>Key questions to ask:</p>

   <li>Are we treating all retailers the same?</li> 
   <li>Are we providing a different service or information to a particular retailer which may alter the level playing field?</li>
