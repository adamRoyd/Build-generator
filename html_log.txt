  <p>Mondelēz International wants to be a global snacking company that drives growth in snacking around the world. We need to build our capabilities in how we work together to drive snacking growth. We've developed a simple, common approach to Activating Category and Customer Growth Together (ACCT). </p> 
  <p>ACCT is our new way of working, establishing one way of driving category growth across all Mondelēz International markets, from identifying growth opportunities to implementing in key retail environments with strategic customers. </p> 
  <p>ACCT helps us: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>identify compelling insights, do a commercial assessment, and discover global growth opportunities</li> 
   <li>prioritize the ones most relevant for each region</li> 
   <li>plan with our customers the best activations that will grow the snacking category</li> 
   <li>then finally implement it all brilliantly, measuring and learning as we go. </li> 
  </ul>
