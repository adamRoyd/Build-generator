  <p>SCREEN 01_100</p> 
  <p>SCREEN TYPE Text and Graphic</p> 
  <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p> 
  <p>This screen presents information, sometimes with an illustrative graphic/image, and sometimes with typography, such as a pull-quote. There are no learning instructions or interactions. The layout of text and image will vary based on the requirements of the content.</p> 
  <p>We will challenge learners to think about how MDLZ relies on Information Technology and Solutions. </p> 
  <p><b>IMAGE</b></p> 
  <p>Image echoing the menu screens across this and other Landmarks. People working in different locations in MDLZ, all using technology solutions. </p> 
  <p><b>BODY TEXT</b> </p> 
  <p>Hi there! You probably already know that technology is ingrained in every part of our business – from the humble day-to-day work to our greatest strategic ambitions. </p> 
  <p>ITS stands for Information Technology and Solutions. All of these three words describe what we provide for the company to run the business and attain its goals– It is about using information to provide technology and process based solutions that enable business capabilities and connect our Mondelēz world.</p> 
  <p>Let's try a quick exercise – you don't need to write anything down. Just think about your own role in Mondelēz International (MDLZ). Think about what you know about the rest of the organization. Can you think of any area that isn't supported by a technology or process-based solution? Sometimes these solutions work so well, you hardly notice they're even there. </p> 
  <p>Take a moment to reflect. When you're ready, we can start to explore the exciting ways that ITS connects the whole MDLZ world. </p> 
  <p>SCREEN 01_110</p> 
  <p>SCREEN TYPE<b>: </b>Multiple choice question (correct, partial &amp; incorrect feedback)</p> 
  <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p> 
  <p>A question and several answer options. The learner selects the option or options that they believe are correct, then they select a Confirm button. The correct answer(s) are then indicated and feedback once the user submits their chosen answer. The guide provides narration for these screens, so the audio icon will be present.</p> 
  <p><b>QUESTION AUDIO </b></p> 
  <p>That was probably a tricky thing to do. That's because ITS solutions reach into just about every part of our work. Let's think some more about your contact with ITS today. </p> 
  <p><b>QUESTION TEXT </b>(30 words max)</p>

  <p>Reducing cost is something we all strive for, but in ITS it means making our own processes more efficient, and reducing cost for MDLZ on a global level. We ask ourselves: Have we moved towards more engaging user experiences? Are we making people more self-sufficient? Are we being ruthless in the technology choices we make and ensuring anything outside of our portfolio is quickly retired? Are we keeping our costs within a competitive range? </p>
