  <p>TRANSCRIPT</p> 
  <p>Welcome to the high-tech Research, Development and Quality building. We call this function RDQ for short. </p> 
  <p>Our visit here will take about half an hour. During that time you'll see how the global RDQ teams <b>discover</b> the science and technology to meet our consumers' needs. You'll find out how they <b>develop</b> delicious new products and then <b>deploy</b> them into markets across the world. </p> 
  <p>Here at RDQ our teams don't just create our tasty snacks, they also design the processes to make them. We develop and create all the packaging too. </p> 
  <p>Most importantly, we make sure our products are safe, comply with local regulations, and meet the high quality consumers expect.</p> 
  <p>You can leave the tour at any time and come back whenever you like. You'll start at the same point you left.</p> 
  <p>Let's go in!</p> 
  <p>BUTTON</p> 
  <p>Enter RDQ</p> 
  <p>Menu</p> 
  <p>DESCRIPTION</p> 
  <p>The menu is a horizontally scrolling stylized interpretation of the work environment. It has several areas representing each of the topics in this module. Each area has an icon that the learner selects to access the relevant topic. Topic titles and durations are shown next to the icon as it passes through the central areas of the screen. No duration is shown for the Resources Room as it contains multiple items of discretionary content of variable length. The menu has audio, so it shows the audio icon. The first topic icon should be in view and showing its title at the opening position of the menu.</p> 
  <p>[<b>NOTE TO BW GRAPHIC DESIGN TEAM:</b> Images of <b>single individuals </b>should be kept to minimum level within the RDQ module. Collaboration is key to this department so pics and photos must ALWAYS <b>show people working as a team, 2 people minimum.]</b></p>

When you want to leave this landmark, select the exit icon at the top of the screen. I'll remember where you were, so we can continue your tour when you return.

  <p>BODY TEXT (Max 100 words)</p> 
  <p>Over 10 years ago, RDQ were asked to develop a Heat Resistant Chocolate (HRC). </p> 
  <p>The challenge was to create chocolate which would remain solid above 32oC, and still taste great</p> 
  <p>Such a chocolate would help us move into must-win markets in hot climates, where refrigeration isn't always available. </p> 
  <p>It sounded like an impossible task! </p> 
  <p>Like any challenge, teamwork was key to solving this sticky problem.</p>

  <p>Our role is to foster a culture that promotes reapplication over reinvention, basically: "What can we learn and re-use from previous successes?" This helps us reach solutions faster – or literally accelerate innovation.</p> 
  <p>For example, we invented a unique foaming agent to improve cappuccino mixes in the early 2000s and have since used the same technology in our popular TANG fruity drinks, in mints and in candy products.</p> 
  <p><b>Did you know…? </b>Astronaut John Glenn took TANG on the Friendship 7 spacecraft in 1962 and on later Gemini missions. Powdered drink mixes are still used on the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

  <p>Brazil goes nuts for 5 Star chocolate bars.</p> 
  <p>When consumer insights showed that Latin America wanted smaller individual bars, rather than large chocolate blocks, we saw a way to get into the must-win Brazilian market. Our product and process teams in India, UK, Brazil, Australia and Ireland worked together to adapt our winning BOOST bar. The project introduced new processes and technology to the Brazilian Curitiba Plant. They made and launched the product, branded as "5 STAR".</p>

  <p>To be competitive in the cheese and dairy marketplace, we needed to reduce the cost of ingredients and processing.</p> 
  <p>Seven years ago the Dairy Research team in Munich, developed a technology that enhanced the creamy texture of our PHILADELPHIA products. This saved millions of Euros by reducing the amount of cream we used. This meant the fat content dropped by 10%, delighting consumers and putting a big, fat tick against our corporate Well-being goals.</p>

  <p>Most wheat grown across the world is hard wheat, great for bread, not good for cookies. Soft Wheat flour absorbs less water and takes less energy to bake (so it's more environmentally friendly). It also makes a softer biscuit, which consumers prefer. </p> 
  <p>We worked with government and research institutes to influence farmers, and finally </p> 
  <p>Mondelēz International successfully increased production of soft wheat varieties in the USA and Canada.</p> 
  <p>Now there's a good supply of soft wheat flour, so we can guarantee consistent high quality in our products.</p>

  <p>Nice work so far. Now there's some consumer insight for you to consider:</p> 
  <p>SIA and Marketing:</p> 
  <p>"Our research has <b>discovered</b> that busy modern lifestyles mean mealtimes aren't as predictable as they used to be. Consumers are looking for convenient, long-life, re-sealable snacks they can carry around to fill those gaps between meals. They need to be both tasty and healthy. Consumers will pay a premium price for the right product."</p> 
  <p>Consumer Science:</p> 
  <p>"The information we have for this type of snack says consumers like distinctive, fruity flavors. We tested different formats with consumers to understand their needs around portion control and size. A pack with two or three portions, which they could eat on the go and store in the packaging was the favorite option.</p> 
  <p>A chewy texture and a product that doesn't break or crumble easily are best."</p>

  <p> </p> 
  <p>QUESTION 2 SELECTION</p> 
  <p>Yes. We can give you lots of help with raw materials. We're working on a fresher tasting fruit ingredient which sounds like it would fit your needs.</p>

  <p>QUESTION 1 SELECTION</p> 
  <p>Sorry, you'll have to look elsewhere for help on processes.</p>

  <p>QUESTION 2 SELECTION</p> 
  <p>Yes. We're happy to advise you about the best suppliers to work with</p> 
  <p>INCORRECT FEEDBACK PROCESS TEAMS</p> 
  <p>Process teams:</p> 
  <p>QUESTION 1 SELECTION</p> 
  <p>We're definitely the right teams to advise you on processes.</p> 
  <p>QUESTION 2 SELECTION</p> 
  <p>We're not really the right people to ask about ingredients or packaging.</p> 
  <p>INCORRECT FEEDBACK PACKAGING</p> 
  <p>Packaging:</p> 
  <p>QUESTION 1 SELECTION</p> 
  <p>Correct! We can advise you on both existing and new packaging solutions. </p> 
  <p>QUESTION 2 SELECTION</p> 
  <p>Yes. We're experts on packaging development. We've been working with suppliers on how to reduce the cost of the re-seal feature, and we think we have some good options! </p>

  <p>Now you've got answers to some important scale up questions. By investing the time to ask questions early on, RDQ can save time and money later in the project. We'll be more confident that we'll be able to make the product correctly when we run the trial in our factory. It will also meet the goals you set at the beginning. Sometimes we need to go slow, so we can go fast!</p> 
  <p>Now we're ready to set up that production trial.</p> 
  <p>SUCCESS SCREEN AUDIO</p> 
  <p>That's great – you've asked all the right questions and got answers from the right people. Now you're ready for that important first production trial. </p>

  <p>The factory needs to know what form the product ingredients will be manufactured in. Select the best form to use.</p> 
  <p>QUESTION 5 AUDIO</p> 
  <p>Right, it's time to decide the best form to use when we manufacture the product.</p>

  <p>Product form:</p>

  <p><b>2</b></p> 
  <p>Tube (Cost: $$)</p> 
  <p><b>Incorrect</b></p> 
  <p><b>3</b></p> 
  <p>Moulded Pieces (Cost: $$$)</p> 
  <p><b>Incorrect</b></p> 
  <p>FEEDBACK SCREEN 5</p> 
  <p>CORRECT FEEDBACK TEXT </p> 
  <p>That's right. Because of the thin, rectangular shape of our end product, sheet and cut is the most economical choice.</p> 
  <p>CORRECT FEEDBACK AUDIO </p> 
  <p>Good job. The factory can now be set up for the production trial.</p> 
  <p>CORRECT BUTTON</p> 
  <p>Move on to the next step</p> 
  <p>INCORRECT FEEDBACK TEXT STEM</p> 
  <p>The process team isn't entirely happy with your choice. Here's what they had to say:</p> 
  <p>INCORRECT FEEDBACK OPTION 2</p> 
  <p>A tube form will give us a stick format which appeals to the consumer, but it isn't the most cost effective route.</p> 
  <p>INCORRECT FEEDBACK OPTION 3</p> 
  <p>Moulded pieces are easy to work with, but the cost is high. We have invested in the packaging cost is high on this product, so we need to look for savings elsewhere.</p> 
  <p>INCORRECT FEEDBACK AUDIO </p> 
  <p>The process team would like you to think again about the product form. Try again when you're ready.</p>

  <p>Your production trial is a success. You've demonstrated that the product can be produced correctly. Your trial production run has also generated samples that our sales team can use to get the retailers excited about the launch of this product.</p> 
  <p>The other great news is that the teams working in the 'discover' areas of Ingredients Research and Packaging have found an orange and mango ingredient that tastes fresher, and a cheaper, re-sealable pack. We’re good to go!</p> 
  <p>You've now reached the end of the <b>Discover</b> and <b>Develop</b> phases. It's time to move on to the <b>Deploy</b> stage.</p>

  <p><b>Deploy</b></p> 
  <p>We've completed a successful first trial, but we're not quite finished yet. There are some things we need to check before we start our first full production run.</p> 
  <p>Which expert team will you use for each of these checks?</p> 
  <p>QUESTION 6 AUDIO</p> 
  <p>Great. We're ready to think about production. Time to ask the right teams of experts your final questions.</p>

  <p>FEEDBACK SCREEN 6</p> 
  <p>CORRECT FEEDBACK TEXT </p> 
  <p>That's right. SARA and Legal make sure we've protected any new inventions and that we're legally free to market and sell our products in the countries we've targeted. </p> 
  <p>Product, Process and Pack Development plus the Quality teams will make sure we can maintain quality standards when we scale up our production. </p>
